      <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
    </p>
    <p num="4">A variable impedance output buffer is designed so that the output impedance of the buffer is set relatively low during an initial portion of an output transition and subsequently the output impedance of the buffer is increased near the end of the output transition to more closely match the characteristic impedance of a transmission line driven by the buffer.

It is important that the circuit is set to trigger the change of output impedance near the end of an output transition in a reliable and consistent manner.

      <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
    </p>
    <p num="19">FIG. 1 shows a variable impedance output buffer circuit. The circuit includes a first pull-up transistor 1 connected in parallel to a second pull-up transistor 2. The switching of the second pull-up transistor 2 is controlled by an overshoot detector circuit 3. On the pull-down side of the buffer circuit, a first pull-down transistor 4 is connected in parallel to a second pull-down transistor 5 which is controlled by an undershoot detect circuit 6. The output impedance of the buffer circuit is a reflection of the combination of the impedances presented by the parallel pairs of pull-up and pull-down transistors. The circuit operates as follows: when an input signal approaches the end of a high going transition, the overshoot detect circuit 3 turns the second pull-up transistor 2 off to remove its conductance from the parallel pair of pull-up transistors, thereby increasing the buffer output impedance so that it substantially matches a characteristic impedance of a transmission line (not shown) driven by the buffer via a pad 7. For a low going transition, the undershoot detects circuit 6 turns the second pull-down transistor 5 off to increase the buffer output impedances at the end of the high to low transition period. A control signal USreset is activated when the pad 7 is not being driven low by either of the pull-down transistors 4 or 5. The control signal is derived from the signal pd controlling the gate of the first pull-down transistor 4 and is used to reset the undershoot detect circuit 6 prior to a low going transistor. Another control signal OSreset is derived from a signal pu controlling the gate of the first pull-up transistor 1 and is used to reset the overshoot detect circuit 3 prior to a high going transition. The control signal OSreset is active when the pad 7 is not being driven high by either of the pull-up transistors 1 or 2. When the output driver is tristate i.e. when the output buffer is not driving the pad 7, neither of thee control signals are active.</p>
    <p num="20">The output buffer circuit of FIG. 1 allows the output impedance to be varied for both falling and rising edges. In practice, however, output buffers may be used in applications where varying the impedance is only needed for one type of transition. For example, if the ringing at the end of the transition from low to high is unlikely to cause an input buffer receiving the transition to trigger falsely then impedance matching for this transition is unnecessary. In this case, only the appropriate components for undershoot prevention need to be included in the output buffer circuit.</p>
    <p num="21">
      FIGS. 2 and 3 show an example of an undershoot detect circuit for use with the variable impedance output buffer of FIG. 1. The circuit is designed to detect transitions on an output of the variable impedance output buffer via a feedback signal F
      <sub>b</sub>
      at or close to zero volts and change the output impedance of the buffer via an undershoot detect signal. The feedback input F
      <sub>b</sub>
      to the circuit is connected to an output pad, as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The circuit operates as follows: when the output of the pad is tristate or high, the e control input USreset is high so that a node N1 with a capacitance C
      <sub>ptr</sub>
      (parasitic in this case) is charged high through transistor Q3. A node N2 is pulled low by the output of the NOR gate G1. During a low going transition, the control input USreset goes low, transistor Q3 turns off, and the node N1 is maintained high. Although the output of the NOR gate G1 is asserted, the pull-up devices of G1 are preferably sized such that they exhibit a high on resistance, so that the voltage level at node N2 rises to a value substantially V
      <sub>TN</sub>
      above a negative supply voltage V
      <sub>SS</sub>
      (gorund), where V
      <sub>TN</sub>
      is the diode voltage of a diode presented by transistor Q2. When the output of the pad reaches a detection threshold of substantially zero volts, transistor Q1 turns on and the voltage at the node N1 is discharged through transistor Q1 to the pad, causing the undershoot output to go high via inverter I1. The undershoot output of the circuit turns the pull-down transistor of the output buffer of FIG. 1 off, thereby increasing the output impedance of the output buffer. After this transition, the output of the NOR gate G1 goes low and the voltage at node N1 is pulled low through transistors Q4 and Q5, thereby ensuring that the undershoot output remains high until the control signal USreset next goes high.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      An advantage of this circuit design is that the undershoot output will always go high i.e., the circuit will always trigger, even if the feedback input F
      <sub>b</sub>
      from the pad never quite reaches zero volts for some reason, since the voltage at node N1 will leak slowly through transistor Q1. The pre-charged node N1 virtually eliminates current being introduced into the feedback path. Accordingly, any resistance introduced between transistor Q1 and the pad will have a negligible effect on the detection threshold.
    </p>
    <p num="24">As shown in FIG. 3, the key components in the undershoot detect circuit are the transistors Q1 and Q2, the gates of which are connected together. Transistor Q2 is diode connected and the matching of the transistor Q1 turn-on point with the diode voltage of the diode presented by the transistor Q2 ensures a consistent voltage detection point at near zero voltage levels and avoids premature triggering. Fine tuning of the detection threshold is achieved by the ratio of the sizes of the pull-up devices of NOR gate G1 and transistor Q2, thereby setting the bias voltage to the gate of transistor Q1.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 4 and 5 show an example of an overshoot detector circuit for use with the variable impedance output buffer of FIG. 1. The circuit is designed to detect transitions on an output of the variable impedance output buffer via a feedback signal F
      <sub>b</sub>
      at or close to a supply voltage Vcc. The feedback input F
      <sub>b</sub>
      to the circuit is connected to an output pad, as shown in FIG. 1. The circuit is arranged to provide a consistent voltage threshold for changing the output impedance of the output buffer via an overshoot detect signal.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The circuit operates as follows: the voltage at node N3 will substantially be at a diode voltage V
      <sub>TP6</sub>
      of diode connected transistor Q6 below the voltage of the feedback input F
      <sub>b</sub>
      when the series connected transistors Q9 and Q10 are switched on. Transistors Q9 and Q10 are preferably sized such that their on resistance is large when compared with transistor Q6. Transistor Q7 will switch off when the voltage at node N3 is at a value of Vcc-V
      <sub>TP7</sub>
      , where V
      <sub>TP7</sub>
      is the threshold voltage of transistor Q7. Hence, as the voltage of the feedback signal F
      <sub>b</sub>
      rises above Vcc, transistor Q7 will turn off and allow the voltage at node N4 to be pulled down by a transistor Q11, preferably sized such that its or resistance is large in comparison to that of transistor Q7. Inverter I3 and transistor Q13 provide a latching function to hold the overshoot output high, thereby turning the second pull-up transistor 2 of the variable impedance output buffer off to increase the output impedance of the output buffer. Transistor Q12 is arranged to reset the circuit in response to a control signal OSreset by forcing the voltage at node N4 high and hence the overshoot output low.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Transistors Q8 to Q11 prevent leakage when the overshoot output is high and/or during a reset mode (OSreset low). Fine adjustment of the threshold voltage for the circuit can be achieved by appropriate sizing of transistors Q10 and Q11 relative to transistors Q6 and Q7. As shown, the well voltage of transistor Q6 is biased by a suitable voltage source to prevent the well junction of transistor Q6 being forward biased with respect to the feedback input F
      <sub>b</sub>
      .
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As shown in FIG. 5, the key components in the overshoot detect circuit are the gate connected transistors Q6 and Q7. Transistor Q6 is diode connected and the matching of the diode voltage V
      <sub>TP6</sub>
      of the diode presented by transistor Q6 with the voltage threshold V
      <sub>TP7</sub>
      of transistor Q7 ensures a consistent voltage detection threshold.
    </p>
    <p num="29">As will be appreciated, the circuits in FIGS. 2 and 4 can instead be used as overshoot and undershoot detector circuits, respectively, simply by swapping all NMOS components for PMOS components (including those associated with the NOR gate G1 in FIG. 2), and vice versa, swapping connections to the supply voltages VCC and VSS, and by inverting the sense of the input and output signals.</p>
