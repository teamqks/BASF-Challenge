      <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
    </p>
    <p num="4">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="5">The present invention relates generally to communication devices and, more particularly, to communication devices which enable a person to send out a communication during an emergency.</p>
    <p num="6">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="7">Communication devices known as call boxes are placed at predetermined locations in an area. The area in which the call boxes are located may be along a highway, in a city or town, in an industrial site, in a hospital, etc. A common form of communication link between a call box and a central receiving station is a hard wire link. However, a hard wire link is very expensive to install. The real estate in which the hard wire links are present, the material costs of the hard wires, and the installation costs add up to a very large overall cost. In this respect, it would be desirable if a call box system can be provided that does not employ hard wire communication links.</p>
    <p num="8">A form of communication link that does not employ hard wires is a radio link. In this respect, it would be desirable if a call box system can be provided which employs radio links. Portable radio transceivers are readily available in the marketplace. In this respect, it would be desirable if a call box system can be provided which employs readily available portable radio transceivers. Portable radio transceivers are battery powered. As a result, batteries must be periodically changed or recharged to assure proper operation of the portable radio transceivers. Yet, it is very labor intensive to have a person visit each call box site either to remove and replace or to recharge depleted batteries. It would be much more economical if each call box had its own dedicated battery recharging system. Just as it is desirable to avoid a hard wire communication link, it is also desirable to avoid a hard wire electrical grid for recharging batteries. In this respect, it would be desirable if a call box system can be provided with a dedicated solar-energy-based battery recharging system for each call box.</p>
    <p num="9">Conventional call boxes often have written instructions located inside the box once the box is opened up by a user. However, for users who have poor eyesight, or for dimly lit conditions, the reading and interpretation of written instructions may be very difficult if not impossible. To alleviate such problems, it would be desirable if a call box had audible instructions for guiding a user through use of the call box. For a call box that employs audible instructions, it would be desirable if the call box could be programmed in its audible instructions in any desirable way. For example, one call box may be programmed in one spoken language, and another call box may be programmed in another language.</p>
    <p num="10">There are persons in society at large who are not able to talk. There are other persons who are not able to use their hands. Yet, an emergency call box should be usable even by persons who are not able to talk and who are not able to use their hands.</p>
    <p num="11">When a hard wired call box system is used, a designated person or person may be on duty for answering call-box calls. Similarly, for a call box system which employs portable radio transceivers, a designated person or persons may be on duty for answering call-box calls. Yet if the designated person or persons are very busy, the caller at the call box may have to wait, and precious time may be lost in an emergency situation. In this respect, it would be desirable if a call box system can be provided in which each call box broadcasts an emergency signal that can be monitored by a large number of persons. For example, citizens band radio has an emergency channel that has a plurality of listeners at any given time. In this respect, it would be desirable if a call box system can be provided which generates a radio broadcast on an emergency radio channel that at any given time usually has a plurality of listeners.</p>
    <p num="12">Thus, while it is well known to use call box systems, a call box system has not been provided which has the following combination of desirable features: (1) does not employ hard wire communication links; (2) employs radio links; (3) employs readily available portable radio transceivers; (4) has a dedicated solar-energy-based battery recharging system for each call box, (5) has audible instructions for guiding a user on what to do to use a call box, (6) can be programmed to provide a wide variety of audible messages or instructions; (7) is usable by persons who are not able to talk and who are not able to use their hands; and (8) can generate an audible radio broadcast on an emergency radio channel that ordinarily has a plurality of listeners. The foregoing desired characteristics are provided by the unique call box apparatus of the present invention as will be made apparent from the following description thereof. Other advantages of the present invention over the prior art also will be rendered evident.</p>

      <h1>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</h1>
    </p>
    <p num="46">With reference to the drawings, a new and improved call box apparatus embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="47">Turning to FIGS. 1-5, there is shown a first embodiment of the call box apparatus of the invention generally designated by reference numeral 10. FIGS. 7-10 also apply to the first embodiment of the invention. In the first embodiment, call box apparatus 10 includes a controller unit 12, a radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 controlled by the controller unit 12, and a sensor assembly 16 connected to the controller unit 12 for controlling operation of the controller unit 12. A power supply assembly 18, an audio storage assembly 20, an output speaker unit 22, and an input microphone unit 24 are connected to the controller unit 12. Generally speaking, the controller unit 12 directs flow of power, signals, and information to and from the other electrical assemblies and units in the call box apparatus 10.</p>
    <p num="48">A housing assembly 34 houses the controller unit 12, the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, the sensor assembly 16, the power supply assembly 18, the audio storage assembly 20, the output speaker unit 22, and the input microphone unit 24.</p>
    <p num="49">The housing assembly 34 includes a hinged door 36. Hinges 38 secure the door 36 to the remainder of the housing assembly 34. The housing assembly 34 includes a first housing portion 33 which supports the door 36, and a second housing portion 35 which supports the first housing portion 33. The second housing portion 35 is supported by the mast 37 by a support bracket 49. The door 36 includes a door lock assembly which includes a door-mounted lock portion 63 and a latch portion 65 mounted on the first housing portion 33. The door-mounted lock portion 63 of the door lock assembly includes a push-button release 67.</p>
    <p num="50">The sensor assembly 16 includes an open-door sensor 32 and a key-operated switch assembly 91. A logic board 40, housed with the housing assembly 34, supports the controller unit 12, a connector 46 for connecting the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 to the controller unit 12, a connector 44 for connecting the open-door sensor 32 to the controller unit 12, a connector 48 for connecting the controller unit 12 to the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, the audio storage assembly 20, a connector 50 for connecting the controller unit 12 to the output speaker unit 22, and a connector 52 for connecting the controller unit 12 to the input microphone unit 24.</p>
    <p num="51">With respect to the second embodiment of the invention disclosed in FIG. 6, the power supply assembly 18 includes a rechargeable battery 26. A solar panel assembly 28 and a power supply interface assembly 30 are connected to the rechargeable battery 26 and the solar panel assembly 28. During the daytime, the solar panel assembly 28 recharges the rechargeable battery 26 by way of the power supply interface assembly 30. Also, during the daytime, power flows from both the rechargeable battery 26 and the solar panel assembly 28 to the controller unit 12. At night, power flows from the rechargeable battery 26, through the power supply interface assembly 30, to the controller unit 12. Two rechargeable batteries 26 are shown in FIG. 3. The circuitry shown in FIGS. 7-10 also applies to the second embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="52">The logic board 40 further supports a connector 54 for connecting the controller unit 12 to the solar panel assembly 28, a variable resistor 56 for controlling audio volume from the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 to the output speaker unit 22, a variable resistor 58 for controlling audio volume from the audio storage assembly 20 to the output speaker unit 22, a variable resistor 60 for regulating voltage received by the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, a variable resistor 62 for controlling gain for the input microphone unit 24, a connector 64 for connecting the input microphone unit 24 to the controller unit 12, and a variable resistor 66 for controlling voltage applied to the rechargeable battery 26. The logic board 40 further supports a signal lamp 68 for indicating that the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 is transmitting and a signal lamp 70 for indicating that the door 36 is open.</p>
    <p num="53">The logic board 40 also supports an ANI connector 72, a variable resistor 73 for controlling ANI TX audio, a connector array 74 for connecting switched output, a connector 75 for connecting to an alternative voltage source, a fuse 76, a connector 77 for a key switch, a connector 78 for a panel PTT, a variable resistor 79 for controlling message TX audio, a connector 80 for a panel light, a connector 81 for an auxiliary sensor for causing activation of the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, a message select switch 82, and a record/play switch 83.</p>
    <p num="54">It is noted that the number "3" position of the message select switch 82 provides instructions; the number "2" position, an ID message; and the number "1", an auxiliary message.</p>
    <p num="55">In using the call box apparatus 10, when the door 36 is closed and the door lock assembly is latched, DC battery drain to the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, the signal lamps 68 and 70, and the logic board 40 is shut off with the exception of the memory and microprocessor "keep alive" circuits. Keeping the entire unit in the "sleep mode" allows an operational life of almost two months to the batteries without recharging. This is especially important for an apparatus that does not employ a solar panel assembly 28. It is noted that the normal battery is removed from the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, and the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 operates from the rechargeable batteries 26 which are heavy duty lead/acid gel cells. These cells are better suited for use as a "float" cell than Nickel-Cadmium portable radio batteries. This is an important consideration when "float-charging" the call box apparatus 10 with the optional solar panel assembly 28 or AC line charger.</p>
    <p num="56">When the door 36 is opened, an automatic sequence follows. Power is applied to the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, signal lamps 68 and 70, and all logic circuits. The radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 transmits an alarm tone (warble) and a voice message identifying the call box apparatus 10. A second voice message emanates from the output speaker unit 22 to deliver user instructions. At this point, the call box apparatus 10 becomes a two-way radio station, and the user may talk directly to a security guard, police officer, dispatcher, or other aiding agency simply by pressing the single large red press-to-talk (PTT) button 41 on the mounting panel 69. Upon releasing the press-to-talk (PTT) button 41, the user hears any radio message directed to the call box apparatus 10. A third voice message may be transmitted in the event a shock sensor (or other device) senses that someone may be tampering with the unit. Each of the three available voice messages is stored in a digital voice-storage module and may be edited or changed in the field by any using agency.</p>
    <p num="57">More specifically, in using the call box apparatus 10 of the invention, the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 can be a conventional or trunked portable radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 for transmitting an alarm tone and a user-programmed first voice message, stored in the audio storage assembly 20, to a remote location on a conventional or trunked, simplex or repeater-based radio channel. After the transmission of the first message, a second voice message is played from the audio storage assembly 20. The second message is generated through the output speaker unit 22 so that it can be heard at the call box apparatus 10 so that the person using the call box apparatus 10 can hear the second message. The second message can be "Press and hold the button to talk. Release the button to listen. Please speak clearly." When the door 36 is opened, the open-door sensor 32 triggers the transmission of the alarm and first voice message. Because the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 installed in the call box apparatus 10 can be a substantially conventional portable transceiver, it functions as a two-way radio station allowing an officer or security guard to speak directly with the user of the call box apparatus 10 to determine the nature of the emergency.</p>
    <p num="58">Access to the logic board 40 is obtained by removing four screws 31 shown in FIG. 2. The removal of the screws 31 permits the first housing portion 33 to be swung around locating pins 39 is connected between the first housing portion 33 and the second housing portion 35. It is important that the first housing portion 33 not be allowed to swing freely on the locating pins 39 because the locating pins 39 are not strongly secured to the first housing portion 33 and the second housing portion 35. The first housing portion 33 should be supported carefully as it is opened with respect to the second housing portion 35.</p>
    <p num="59">The call box apparatus 10 of the invention can be installed either indoors or outdoors. Using support bracket 49 the call box apparatus 10 is installed on the mast 37. Other types of support brackets can be used to support the call box apparatus 10 on a wall. With an outdoor installation, the solar panel assembly 28 is also mounted on the mast 37. To prevent vandalism, all power and antenna cables should run inside the mast 37 and be lead into the housing assembly 34 through a "knock-out" aperture located in the center of the rear wall of the second housing portion 35. A "close nipple" is recommended to protect any wiring running between the housing assembly 34 and a hollow, vertical mast 37. It will be necessary to drill an access hole for this nipple through the vertical mast 37. A second "knock-out" aperture is located in the center of a bottom wall in the housing assembly 34 for conduit or cable connection.</p>
    <p num="60">The recorded messages in the audio storage assembly 20 are arranged as follows. About 2 seconds after opening the door 36, the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 automatically transmits an alert tone followed by the "ID MESSAGE" (Message No. 2). At the end of the "ID MESSAGE", the call box apparatus 10 automatically transmits "INSTRUCTIONS" (Message No. 1) via the output speaker unit 22. Following the "INSTRUCTIONS" message, the radio press-to-talk (PTT) button 41 is pressed allowing direct radio communication with a security agency.</p>
    <p num="61">The audio storage assembly 20 can be implemented in a number of ways. For example, digital voice-storage modules can be employed. The digital voice-storage modules can hold three messages (20 seconds total). The messages can be recorded as desired. To change a recorded message, the following procedure is followed. The door 36 is opened and the first housing portion 33 is rotated open to gain access to the logic board 40. The message select switch 82 and the record/play switch 83 are located. The desired switch position in the message select switch 82 is selected. While holding the record/play switch 83 in the "RECORD" position, the new message is spoken into the logic board 40 using a normal, conversational voice level. One should not shout. The input microphone unit 24 is very sensitive. After recording the new message, the record/play switch 83 is moved to the "PLAY" position. All messages are changed by following the above procedure with particular attention paid to the position of the message select switch 82.</p>
    <p num="62">A number of audio and voltage levels can be adjusted by of variable resistor controls (potentiometers) on the logic board 40. These controls can be set at a factory to match the characteristics of the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 in the call box apparatus 10. These factory settings need not be changed unless significant repairs are made to components in the call box apparatus 10. If a different radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 is substituted for an original radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, the factory settings may have to be changed. Most precise adjustments to the call box apparatus 10 require complex test equipment such as a radio service monitor or similar unit capable of measuring FM power, frequency and deviation levels to the accuracy required to comply with FCC Rules and Regulations. A radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 can be installed in the housing assembly 34 using any suitable tying device such as a "tie wrap". The antenna cable and the radio-accessory cable may need to be attached before fastening the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 in position. The radio power cable is not is connected to the logic board 40 until all other mechanical and electrical connections have been completed and leads dressed so as to allow suitable clearance when the door is closed and the battery or AC power connected.</p>
    <p num="63">The radio voltage regulator can be adjusted as follows. Before turning on the radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14, the voltage appearing at the connector 48 for "RADIO POWER" is measured. The voltage is adjusted by turning the variable resistor 60 for radio voltage regulation to obtain the correct voltage for the radio in use. Next, the radio is turned on, and the adjustment is repeated.</p>
    <p num="64">Optionally, an AC power adapter can be used for powering the call box apparatus 10 from a 120 VAC source. Then, the direct current voltage appearing at the connector 75 for the "SWITCHED 13.8 VDC" is measured. To adjust this voltage, the variable resistor 66 for the "13.8 VDC BATT. CHG. ADJUST" is adjusted to obtain a DC voltage equal to the DC voltage provided by a fully charged rechargeable battery 26.</p>
    <p num="65">To control the audio level from the output speaker unit 22, the following steps are taken. A radio antenna (not shown) is connected to a 50 ohm dummy load. The radio frequency audio transceiver unit 14 is turned on, and the variable resistor 56 for "RADIO AUDIO TO SPEAKER" is adjusted to the low end of the control range. Using a service monitor tuned to the receiver frequency. A 1 KHz signal is generated has a 4 KHz deviation. Variable resistor 56 for "RADIO AUDIO TO SPEAKER" is adjusted to obtain the best sounding audio from the output speaker unit 22. Using a portable radio, voice quality is tested as described above, and the variable resistor 56 for the "RADIO AUDIO TO SPEAKER" is adjusted for clearest transmission.</p>
    <p num="66">To adjust audio level of the output speaker unit 22 when playing a message from the audio storage assembly 20, a particular message is selected by employing the message select switch 82. While holding the record/play switch 83 in the "PLAY" position, the variable resistor 58 for the "MESSAGE AUDIO TO SPEAKER" is adjusted to obtain the desired audio level in the output speaker unit 22.</p>
    <p num="67">To adjust the input microphone unit 24, a service monitor is set to receive radio transmission from the call box apparatus 10. The press-to-talk (PTT) button 41 is pressed, and the variable resistor 62 for "MICROPHONE GAIN" is adjusted to obtain the FCC-authorized deviation as displayed on the monitor.</p>
    <p num="68">To transmit message audio, the service monitor is set to receive radio transmissions from the call box apparatus 10. The door 36 of the call box apparatus 10 is closed, and 5 seconds are permitted to elapse. The door 36 is then opened to initiate automatic message transmission. The monitor display is observed, and the variable resistor 79 for "MESSAGE TX AUDIO" is adjusted during play of the message to obtain the FCC-authorized deviation.</p>
    <p num="69">To obtain an optional ANI audio transmission, an optional ANI Encoder Module (not shown) is installed on the logic board 40 at connector 72. The ANI Encoder Module creates a coded signal of short duration that is transmitted before the ID message is transmitted. The following steps are taken to adjust the modulation level of the ANI transmission. A service monitor is set to receive transmissions from the call box apparatus 10. The door 36 is closed and 5 seconds are permitted to elapse. The door 36 is opened, and automatic message transmission is initiated. The monitor display is observed, and variable resistor 73 for "ANI TX AUDIO" is adjusted to obtain FCC-authorized deviation. Because of the very short duration of the ANI transmission, it may be necessary to repeat the procedure several times to obtain the proper level setting.</p>
    <p num="70">The call box apparatus 10 can also be equipped to provide auxiliary outputs that may be used to control a variety of external functions. More specifically, a relay 85 includes a relay coil 87 which controls the connector array 74. More specifically, the connector array 74 includes a SPDT switch arrangement. The relay 85 is rated at 120 VAC, 5 amperes, non-inductive.</p>
    <p num="71">The input microphone unit 24, the key-operated switch assembly 91, the press-to-talk (PTT) button 41, and the output speaker unit 22 are all mounted on a common mounting panel 69.</p>
    <p num="72">Plugs, connectors, cables, and variable resistors used in the call box apparatus 10 are, for the most part, off-the-shelf items readily available through electronics suppliers. For greater reliability, crimp-style connections may be used in place of soldered connections.</p>
    <p num="73">Numerous optional features are available for use with the call box apparatus 10 of the invention. For example, there can be provided keychain and pendant alarm transmitters, a silent vandalism alarm, flashing strobe alerts, and ANI equipment for automatic ID, recording, and test functions.
