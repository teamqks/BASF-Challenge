      <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
    </p>
    <p num="4">1. Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="5">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having an SOI (Silicon On Insulator) structure.</p>
    <p num="6">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="7">A dynamic random access memory (referred to as DRAM hereinafter) that allows random input and output of stored information is well known as a semiconductor device. A DRAM includes a memory cell array which is the memory region of storing information and a peripheral circuit required for input/output with respect to an external source.</p>
    <p num="8">An exemplary structure of a DRAM memory cell will be described hereinafter. FIG. 30 is a sectional view of a general DRAM memory cell. This memory cell includes a typical stacked type capacitor.</p>
    <p num="9">Referring to FIG. 30, a memory cell includes one transfer gate transistor and one stacked type capacitor.</p>
    <p num="10">The transfer gate transistor includes a pair of source/drain regions 30, 30 formed on a surface of a silicon substrate 1, and a gate electrode (word line) 6 formed on the surface of silicon substrate 1 with an insulating layer therebetween.</p>
    <p num="11">The stacked type capacitor includes a lower electrode (storage node) 9 extending from over gate electrode 6 to a field isolation film 4, and having a portion thereof connected to one of source/drain regions 30, 30, a dielectric layer 901 formed on the surface of lower electrode 9, and an upper electrode (cell plate) 902 formed thereon.</p>
    <p num="12">A bit line 10 is connected to the other source/drain region 30 of the transfer gate transistor via a bit line contact unit 100.</p>
    <p num="13">In recent years, the technology of transistors using an SOI structure has evolved. Such a transistor of an SOI structure is characterized in that the operation of circuitry is speeded, according to reduction in the capacitance between the interconnection and the substrate, i.e. the wiring capacitance. When this transistor is applied to a CMOS, the latch up phenomenon can be prevented. There are also various advantages such as the short channel effect is reduced, the current driving capability and the subthreshold characteristics are improved.</p>
    <p num="14">Therefore, application of an SOI structure into a memory cell of a DRAM is considered.</p>
    <p num="15">However, in the stage of applying an SOI structure into a memory cell of a DRAM, the following problems were generated.</p>
    <p num="16">FIGS. 31A-31F are sectional views of a memory cell of an SOI structure showing the first to sixth manufacturing steps thereof for describing the problems encountered in the manufacturing process. The main steps of the manufacturing method of the present memory cell are shown.</p>
    <p num="17">Referring to FIG. 31A, a silicon substrate 1 is prepared. Oxygen ions are implanted from above silicon substrate 1 with silicon substrate 1 is heated to a predetermined temperature. Then, annealing is carried out at a high temperature.</p>
    <p num="18">
      As a result, silicon substrate 1 reacts with the oxygen ions, whereby an insulating layer 2 of silicon oxide (SiO
      <sub>2</sub>
      ) is formed. The defects generated by oxygen ion implantation are eliminated, whereby the crystalline property thereof is recovered. As a result, a silicon layer of single crystalline (referred to as SIO layer hereinafter) 3 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Thus, an insulating layer 2 is located at the depth of 5000-10000 Å from the top face of the original silicon substrate. On insulating layer 2, a first conductivity type SOI layer 3 having a thickness of approximately 1000 Å is formed.</p>
    <p num="20">Then, a field oxide film 4 is formed on the main surface of silicon substrate 1.</p>
    <p num="21">Referring to FIG. 31B, the surface of SOI layer 3 is processed by thermal oxidation, whereby a gate oxide film 5 is formed on the surface of SOI layer 3. Gate oxide film 5 has a thickness of approximately 100 Å. Here, the thickness of SOI layer 3 is reduced by the thickness of gate oxide film 5. Then, a gate electrode layer 60 of polysilicon is formed on gate oxide film 5.</p>
    <p num="22">Referring to FIG. 31C, using a resist pattern (not shown) formed on gate electrode layer 60 located above the center portion between field oxide films 4, 4 as a mask, gate electrode layer 60 and gate oxide film 5 are etched away to be patterned. By this patterning, gate electrode 6 is formed.</p>
    <p num="23">In this patterning step, SOI layer 3 beneath gate electrode layer 60 removed by etching is also removed due to that etching process.</p>
    <p num="24">Referring to FIG. 31D, ions are implanted into one of the pair of regions in SOI layer 3 sandwiching the region beneath gate electrode 6 between field insulating films 4, 4, whereby a first impurity region (drain region or source region) 31 of a second conductivity type is formed.</p>
    <p num="25">Then, an interlayer insulating layer 71 is formed so as to cover the surface of SOI layer 3, gate electrode 6, and field oxide films 4, 4. Interlayer insulating layer 71 on first impurity region 31 is removed by etching. As a result, a contact hole 71 is formed.</p>
    <p num="26">In this formation of contact hole 710, SOI layer 3 is removed by the influence of the etching process. Then, a bit line layer 100 of polysilicon is formed on the surface of interlayer insulating layer 71 so as to come into contact with SOI layer 3 through contact hole 710.</p>
    <p num="27">Referring to FIG. 31E, using a resist pattern (not shown) of a predetermined configuration as a mask, bit line layer 100 is etched away to be patterned. In this patterning process, interlayer insulating layer 71 on a region of S0I layer 3 located opposite to first impurity region 31 with the region beneath gate electrode 6 therebetween is removed by etching at the same time. This is because interlayer insulating layer 71 is etched easier than bit line layer 100 of polysilicon.</p>
    <p num="28">As interlayer insulating layer 71 is removed, the portion of SOI layer 3 beneath the removed interlayer insulating layer 71 is also exposed and removed.</p>
    <p num="29">Referring to FIG. 31F, ions are implanted into the exposed SOI layer 3, whereby an impurity region 32 of a second conductivity type is formed. Then, an interlayer insulating layer 72 is formed. Interlayer insulating layer 72 located on the region of SOI layer 3 opposite to first impurity region 31 with the region beneath gate electrode layer 6 therebetween is removed by etching to form a contact hole 720. In the formation of contact hole 720, SOI layer 3 is removed due to this etching process.</p>
    <p num="30">Then, a lower electrode layer is formed on the surface of interlayer insulating layer 72 so as to come into contact with SOI layer 3 through contact hole 720. The lower electrode layer is patterned, whereby a storage node (lower electrode) 9 is formed.</p>
    <p num="31">After this step of FIG. 31F, a dielectric layer and a cell plate (upper electrode) are sequentially formed on storage node 9.</p>
    <p num="32">When an SOI structure is applied to a DRAM memory cell, there was the problem that the thickness of SOI layer 3 is reduced in manufacturing a memory cell. In the worst case, a through hole in SOI layer 3 was generated. The reason why the thickness of SOI layer 3 is reduced is summarized as follows.</p>
    <p num="33">First, the thickness of SOI layer 3 is reduced due to the thermal oxidation process in forming gate oxide film 5. Then, SOI layer 3 is removed also in the patterning process of gate electrode layer 60. SOI layer 3 is also removed during formation of contact holes 710 and 720. Furthermore, SOI layer 3 is removed in patterning the conductive layer located right above the gate electrode such as bit line layer 100.</p>
    <p num="34">When this impurity region is to be formed as a LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure, SOI layer 3 is also removed in the etching process of the sidewall.</p>
    <p num="35">Thus, there was the problem that the thickness of the SOI layer is significantly removed during the manufacturing process in the case where an SOI structure is applied to a DRAM memory cell. This reduction causes various problems such as contact failure between the SOI layer and a conductive layer such as a storage node in contact thereto.</p>
    <p num="36">The above-described status is encountered not only in a DRAM memory cell, but also in a general transistor. More specifically, it occurs in the case where the structure right above a source region differs from that right above a drain region in a pair of source/drain regions in a transistor. A typical example of a transistor of such a structure is a transistor of a DRAM memory cell.</p>
    <p num="37">The type of a conductive layer right above the source/drain region of a transistor differs depending upon the structure of the memory cell. Therefore, the above-described problem also occurs in the case where the conductive layer right above the source/drain region of the transistor is a polypad, a storage node interconnection layer, or a bit line interconnection layer.</p>
    <p num="38">The above-described problem is not limited to a DRAM memory cell, and is seen also in a SRAM (problems identical to those in a DRAM memory cell occurs). Furthermore, the above-described problem occurs in a general CMOS circuit in which polypads are respectively formed at the power supply side and the ground side, and not formed at the signal output side, or vice versa.</p>

    <p num="43">A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention includes the following steps.</p>
    <p num="44">A semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type is formed on a main surface of a semiconductor substrate with a first insulating layer therebetween. A gate electrode layer is formed on the surface of the semiconductor layer with a gate insulating layer therebetween. The gate electrode layer and the gate insulating layer are etched so that a first partial surface of the semiconductor layer is exposed. A first impurity region of a second conductivity type is formed within the semiconductor layer below the first partial surface. A second insulating layer is formed covering the gate electrode layer and having a first contact hole reaching the first partial surface. A first conductive layer is formed covering the surface of the second insulating layer and connected to the first partial surface via the first contact hole. The first conductive layer and the second insulating layer are etched to expose a partial surface of the gate electrode layer. The gate electrode layer and the gate insulating layer are etched to expose a second partial surface of the semiconductor layer. A third insulating layer is formed covering the gate electrode layer and the first conductive layer, and having a second contact hole reaching the second partial surface.

    <p num="45">In the first etching process of the gate electrode layer, the gate electrode layer is left on the portion of the semiconductor layer where a second impurity region is to be formed afterwards.</p>
    <p num="46">The etching process applied above the second partial surface of the semiconductor layer after formation of the first conductive layer is carried out in two steps. In the first step, the first conductive layer and the second insulating layer are etched. In the second step, the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating layer are etched.</p>
    <p num="47">Although the second partial surface of the semiconductor layer is susceptible to etching during the second etching step of the gate electrode layer, it is impervious to the etching of the first conductive layer in the first etching step.</p>
    <p num="48">In the second etching step, a small amount which has a short distance from the surface of the gate electrode layer to the surface of the semiconductor layer is etched. Therefore, the etching amount can be adjusted easily. The etching progress can be stopped at the surface of the semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="49">According to the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, when the first conductive layer above the gate electrode layer is to be etched, the gate electrode layer is left therebeneath, and the etching process of the first conductive layer and the gate electrode layer is carried out in two steps.</p>
    <p num="50">Because only a small amount is to be etched in the second etching step of the gate electrode layer, the etching progress can be stopped at the surface of the semiconductor layer. Therefore, the amount that is removed from an SOI layer can be suppressed in the manufacturing process.</p>
    <p num="51">A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to another aspect of the present invention includes the following steps.</p>
    <p num="52">A semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type is formed on a main surface of a semiconductor substrate with a first insulating layer therebetween.

    <p num="53">As described above, in the first etching step of the gate electrode layer, the gate electrode layer is left on a portion of the semiconductor layer where a second impurity region is to be formed afterwards.</p>
    <p num="54">In the etching process applied above the second partial surface of the semiconductor layer after formation of the first conductive layer, the first conductive layer, the second insulating layer, the gate electrode layer and gate insulating layer are etched at one step.</p>
    <p num="55">Although the second partial surface of the semiconductor layer is subjected to the influence of etching in etching the gate electrode layer in the step of exposing the second partial surface of the semiconductor layer, it is impervious to the etching process when the first conductive layer is etched away.

    <p num="58">As described above, using a resist pattern exposing the second and third regions at the surface of the gate electrode layer as a mask, impurities are implanted into the semiconductor layer.

    <p num="64">The first and second impurity regions are formed at the same time by implanting impurities into the semiconductor layer via the gate electrode and the gate insulating layer.

    <p num="130">Memory cell array 201 serves to store data signals of stored information. Row and column address buffer 202 receives an externally applied address signal for selecting a memory cell forming a unitary storage circuit. Row decoder 203 and column decoder 204 decode an address signal to specify a memory cell.</p>

    <p num="132">In a semiconductor chip of the above-described DRAM 200, memory cells for storing unitary storage information are arranged in a matrix in memory cell array 201.</p>
    <p num="133">A method of manufacturing a memory cell when a DRAM memory cell is to be formed with an SOI structure will be described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 2A-2G showing the main steps. Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, processes similar to those shown in FIGS. 31A and 31B are carried out. More specifically, an insulating layer 2, an SOI layer 3 of a first conductivity type, and a field oxide film 4 are formed on a semiconductor substrate 1. Then, a gate oxide film 5 and a gate electrode layer 60 are formed.</p>
    <p num="134">Referring to FIG. 2C, gate electrode layer 60 and gate oxide film 5 located above one of the pair of impurity regions of SOI layer 3 and the field oxide film 4 adjacent to that one impurity region are removed by etching. Gate electrode layer 60 is partially patterned. As a result, a partial surface of SOI layer 3 is exposed.</p>
    <p num="135">Referring to FIG. 2D, ion implantation is carried out on the exposed portion of SOI layer 3, whereby an impurity region 31 of a second conductivity type is formed. Then, an interlayer insulating layer 71 is formed to cover the surface of SOI layer 3, gate electrode layer 60, and field oxide film 4.</p>
    <p num="136">Interlayer insulating layer 71 on impurity region 31 is removed by etching to form a contact hole 710. A polysilicon layer 80 is formed on the surface of interlayer insulating layer 71 so as to come into contact with impurity region 31 of SOI layer 3 via contact hole 710.</p>
    <p num="137">Referring to FIG. 2E, using a resist pattern of a predetermined configuration as a mask, polysilicon layer 80 is removed by etching except for the portion above and in the proximity of impurity region 31. As a result of the patterning, a polypad 8 is formed.</p>
    <p num="138">Referring to FIG. 2F, gate electrode layer 60 on the other impurity region of SOI layer 3 and on the gate oxide film 4 adjacent to the other impurity region is removed by etching, whereby gate electrode layer 60 is patterned.</p>
    <p num="139">As a result, gate electrode 6 is formed and a partial surface of SOI layer 3 is exposed.</p>
    <p num="140">Referring to FIG. 2G, an interlayer insulating layer 72 is formed so as to cover SOI layer 3, field oxide film 4, gate 6, and polypad 8. Then, interlayer insulating layer 72 located above SOI layer 3 in which the other impurity region is to be formed is removed by etching to form a contact hole 720.</p>
    <p num="141">A lower electrode layer of polysilicon is formed on the surface of interlayer insulating layer 72 so as to come into contact with SOI layer 3 via contact hole 720. It is patterned, resulting in a storage node 9. Then, a predetermined thermal treatment is applied, whereby impurities are diffused from storage node 9 into a region of SOI layer 3 thereunder. As a result, an impurity region 32 of a second conductivity type is formed in SOI layer 3.</p>
    <p num="142">Although not shown in the above description and in FIGS. 2A-2G, a bit line is formed on polypad 8 before storage node 9 is formed.</p>
    <p num="143">According to a manufacturing method of the first embodiment, when polysilicon layer 80 above gate electrode 6 is to be patterned, gate electrode layer 60 exists beneath the portion to be patterned. At the first step, polysilicon layer 80 and interlayer insulating layer 71 are removed by etching. At the second step, gate electrode layer 60 and gate oxide film 5 are removed by etching. Therefore, the portion of SOI layer 3 where impurity region 32 is formed is impervious to the etching process of polysilicon layer 80.</p>
    <p num="144">In the second etching step of gate electrode layer 60 and gate oxide film 5, a small amount from the surface of gate electrode layer 60 to the surface of SOI layer 3 is removed by etching. Therefore, the etching amount can be easily adjusted. The etching progress can easily be stopped at the surface of SO0 layer 3.</p>
    <p num="145">According to the manufacturing method of a memory cell of the first embodiment, the amount that is removed from SOI layer 3 caused by the etching process of the layer above SOI layer 3 is suppressed.</p>
    <p num="146">The present invention is not limited to the manufacturing method of the first embodiment where polysilicon layer 80 which is a conductive layer closest to gate electrode 6 is used for forming polypad 8, and is similarly applicable in the case where polysilicon layer 80 is a layer for forming a bit line.</p>
    <p num="147">The method of forming impurity region 31 in the manufacturing process of the memory cell may be carried out by diffusing impurities from polypad 8. Also, impurity region 32 may be formed by ion implantation in the present manufacturing process of the memory cell.</p>

    <p num="150">Referring to FIG. 3, gate electrodes 6, 6 form word lines. In a memory cell, a word line and a bit line 10 are disposed so as to cross each other at right angles. More specifically, a word line extends in a row direction, and bit line 10 extends in the column direction. Storage nodes 9, 9 are positioned sandwiching bit line 10. The word lines are positioned sandwiching polypad 8. Element formation region FL is provided in a direction inclined with respect to the word line.</p>

    <p num="157">Referring to FIG. 5F, storage node 9 and impurity region 32 are formed in a manner similar to the steps shown in FIG. 2G.</p>

More specifically, polysilicon layer 80, interlayer insulating layer 71, gate electrode layer 60 and gate oxide film 5 are removed by etching at one time.</p>
    <p num="159">Therefore, the portion of SOI layer 3 where impurity region 32 is formed is impervious to the etching process of polysilicon layer 80 when the conductive layer thereof is etched. It is only susceptible to the etching process of gate electrode layer 60.</p>
